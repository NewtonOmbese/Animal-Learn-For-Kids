 ## Description
 This project is a web application that helps both kindergarten teachers and pupils. It reduces the efforts from the teachers which at points comes to be tiring. It helps pupils to learn from any place since it is accessible from anywhere not neccessarily being at school but also at home and other places. It also provides user interactivity with the application.
